            Hey — I'm Aylen. I've spent the last 20+ years knee-deep in real estate contracts, timelines, and inboxes that should honestly come with a warning label. I've worked with buyers, sellers, lenders, and title companies — and I've survived every "where's that form?" meltdown you can imagine.

            This isn't some startup experiment.<br/>
            It's a tool built by someone who's been there — probably in heels, sweating through a closing with no AC and a missing wire transfer.

            Welcome to your new sidekick.<br/>
