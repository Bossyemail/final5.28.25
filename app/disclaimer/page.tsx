          <p>BossyEmail is a software platform designed to help real estate professionals craft faster, smarter, sassier emails. While we aim to provide helpful and accurate content, the information generated or provided by BossyEmail is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice, financial advice, or a substitute for professional judgment.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Always double-check important communications and edit as needed. You're the one pressing "send," not us.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Real Estate-Specific Content</h2>
          <p>BossyEmail creates messages, templates, and suggestions tailored for real estate agents, brokers, and transaction coordinators. We've been around enough contracts to make you blush â€” but we're not a law firm, and using our content doesn't create any client-attorney anything.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">So yes, BossyEmail can and will make mistakes (just like that one buyer who changed their mind three times). It's your responsibility to review and confirm accuracy, compliance, and all legal requirements based on your local market and brokerage policies.</p>
